# Inner Chapter 
This readme will focus on the back-end of the project.  To learn more about the project as a whole, go to the ICJournal readme.

## Database and Website
While the front-end Wechat program gathers user data, there needs to be a space for Inner Chapter to create, organize, and analyze the data received.  I used Ruby on Rails and SQL in order to create a website and database that stores all of this information.  

## Organization
Not only does this website work as a database, it was also created to serve as an organizational space for all of their projects.  In these projects, tasks can be created that are then sent directly to the users.   
On here, Inner Chapter is also able to use this website for other organization purposes like sorting the users into specific marketing segments in order to maximize the span of their research.
